- 1-to-1 relation between fact classes and .pm files?  If so, we need to fix our
  test facts elsewhere (C::M::Fact at least)

- Where should fact classes be loaded?  Anywhere that facts are deserialized,
  we need the class for the type to be loaded. Who deserializes? gateway does it,
  archives do it, even report does it for facts it contains

- We validate submissions at the gateway, but we don't validate things coming out
  directly from the librarian.  Should we?  Per last point, someone using librarian
  or archive might need them to load classes for facts.  Should they be restricted to
  a defined list?
